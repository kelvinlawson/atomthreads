 * Idle thread stack size
 *
 * This needs to be large enough to handle any interrupt handlers
 * and callbacks called by interrupt handlers (e.g. user-created
 * timer callbacks) as well as the saving of all context when
 * switching away from this thread.
 *
 * In this case, the idle stack is allocated on the BSS via the
 * idle_thread_stack[] byte array.
 */
#define IDLE_STACK_SIZE_BYTES       8192


/*
 * Main thread stack size
 *
 * Note that this is not a required OS kernel thread - you will replace
 * this with your own application thread.
 *
 * In this case the Main thread is responsible for calling out to the
 * test routines. Once a test routine has finished, the test status is
 * printed out on the UART and the thread remains running in a loop
 * flashing a LED.
 *
 * The Main thread stack generally needs to be larger than the idle
 * thread stack, as not only does it need to store interrupt handler
 * stack saves and context switch saves, but the application main thread
 * will generally be carrying out more nested function calls and require
 * stack for application code local variables etc.
 *
 * With all OS tests implemented to date on the AVR, the Main thread
 * stack has not exceeded 198 bytes. To allow all tests to run we set
 * a minimum main thread stack size of 204 bytes. This may increase in
 * future as the codebase changes but for the time being is enough to
 * cope with all of the automated tests.

#define MAIN_STACK_SIZE_BYTES       8192


/*
 * Startup code stack
 *
 * Some stack space is required at initial startup for running the main()
 * routine. This stack space is only temporarily required at first bootup
 * and is no longer required as soon as the OS is started. By default
 * GCC sets this to the top of RAM (RAMEND) and it grows down from there.
 * Because we only need this temporarily, though, it would be wasteful to
 * set aside a region at the top of RAM which is not used during runtime.
 *
 * What we do here is to reuse part of the idle thread's stack during
 * initial startup. As soon as we enter the main() routine we move the
 * stack pointer to half-way down the idle thread's stack. This is used
 * temporarily while calls are made to atomOSInit(), atomThreadCreate()
 * and atomOSStart(). Once the OS is started this stack area is no
 * longer required, and can be used for its original purpose (for the
 * idle thread's stack).
 *
 * This does mean, however, that we cannot monitor the stack usage of the
 * idle thread. Stack usage is monitored by prefilling the stack with a
 * known value, and we are obliterating some of that prefilled area by
 * using it as our startup stack, so we cannot use the stack-checking API
 * to get a true picture of idle thread stack usage. If you wish to 
 * monitor idle thread stack usage for your applications then you are
 * free to use a different region for the startup stack (e.g. set aside
 * an area permanently, or place it somewhere you know you can reuse
 * later in the application). For the time being, this method gives us a
 * simple way of reducing the memory consumption without having to add
 * any special AVR-specific considerations to the automated test
 * applications.
 *
 * This optimisation was required to allow some of the larger automated
 * test modules to run on devices with 1KB of RAM. You should avoid doing
 * this if you can afford to set aside 64 bytes or so, or if you are
 * writing your own applications in which you have further control over
 * where data is located.

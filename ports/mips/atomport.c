/**
 * This function initialises each thread's stack during creation, before the
 * thread is first run. New threads are scheduled in using the same
 * context-switch function used for threads which were previously scheduled
 * out, therefore this function should set up a stack context which looks
 * much like a thread which has been scheduled out and had its context saved.
 * We fill part of the stack with those registers which are involved in the
 * context switch, including appropriate stack or register contents to cause
 * the thread to branch to its entry point function when it is scheduled in.
 *
 * Interrupts should also be enabled whenever a thread is restored, hence
 * ports may wish to explicitly include the interrupt-enable register here
 * which will be restored when the thread is scheduled in. Other methods
 * can be used to enable interrupts, however, without explicitly storing
 * it in the thread's context.

* @authors Natie van Rooyen
*
* @section intro Introduction
* Atomvm is a tiny virtual machine that runs on Windows and can be debugged 
* from an IDE like Microsoft Visual C++ Express. The primary purpose of this 
* virtual machine is for the evaluation of Real Time Operating Systems (like 
* Atomthreads) and the development and testing of modules for this Real Time 
* Operating System on a Windows machine.
* 
* Atomvm makes use of the Windows API functions GetThreadContext() and 
* SetThreadContext() to create multiple virtual contexts or threads inside a 
* single Windows thread. Atomvm also simulates interrupts with an interrupt 
* mask accessible from the Atomvm threads. External events can be queued as 
* interrupts to Atomvm, for example a timer loop generating system timer tick 
* interrupts for a Real Time Operating System ported to Atomvm.

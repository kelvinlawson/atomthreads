STM8 PORT - SMALL DEVICE C COMPILER

This folder contains a port of the Atomthreads real time kernel for the
STM8 processor architecture. These instructions cover usage of Atomthreads
with the Small Device C Compiler (SDCC).

This README covers usage of Atomthreads with SDCC.
Instructions for users of the other compilers are available in README-COSMIC
and README-IAR.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

STM8 DEVICE HEADERS

The folder stm8-include contains:
  - config.h for device selection and some project settings
  - (some) open-source device headers from https://github.com/gicking/STM8_headers
    These replace the proprietary headers/drivers by STM from the original STM8 port

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREREQUISITES

The port works out-of-the-box with SDCC and GNU make for
building.

 * SDCC 3.6.0 or later
 * Programming software (e.g. stm8flash or stm8gal)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUILD VIA MAKEFILE

 * make -f sdcc.mak

All objects are built into the 'build-sdcc' folder under ports/stm8.
The build process builds separate target applications for each automated
test, and appropriate .ihx files can be found in the build folder
ready for downloading to and running on the target. Because of the limited
resources on the STM8, and the large amount of automated tests, each test
is built and run as a separate application.

All built objects etc can be cleaned using:

 * make -f sdcc.mak clean

The Atomthreads sources are documented using Doxygen markup. You can build
both the kernel and STM8 port documentation from this folder using:

 * make -f sdcc.mak doxygen


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROGRAMMING MAKEFILE-BUILT APPLICATIONS TO THE TARGET DEVICE

Applications can be written onto the STM8 board using:

 * SWIM: stm8flash -c stlink -p stm8s105c6 -w <filename>

 * Bootloader: stm8gal -p <port> -V 1 -w <filename>

/**
 * \b thread_shell
 *
 * Shell routine which is used to call all thread entry points.
 *
 * This routine is called whenever a new thread is starting, and is
 * responsible for taking the entry point parameter off the TCB
 * and passing this into the thread entry point, as well as enabling
 * interrupts.
 *
 * This is an optional function for a port, because interrupts could
 * be enabled by the first-thread and normal context restore routines,
 * but that would require special handling in the normal context
 * switch routine (archContextSwitch()) that is only needed the first
 * time a thread is started. A much neater method is to direct all
 * threads through this shell routine first, so that interrupts will
 * always be enabled at thread startup, and no special first-time-run
 * handling is required in the context restore routines (i.e. we
 * don't affect normal context switch times just for the benefit of
 * the first time a thread is restored by adding extra complication
 * to the thread restore routines).
 *
 * Other ports are free to implement whatever scheme they wish. In
 * particular if you save all necessary registers (including the
 * interrupt enable register) on a context switch then you need not
 * worry about any special requirements for starting threads for the
 * first time because you can preinitialise the stack context with
 * a suitable register value that will enable interrupts.
 *
 * If the compiler supports it, stack space can be saved by preventing
 * the function from saving registers on entry. This is because we
 * are called directly by the context-switch assembler, and know that
 * threads cannot return from here. The NO_REG_SAVE macro is used to
 * denote such functions in a compiler-agnostic way, though not all
 * compilers support it.

/**
 * \b archThreadContextInit
 *
 * Architecture-specific thread context initialisation routine.
 *
 * This function must set up a thread's context ready for restoring
 * and running the thread via archFirstThreadRestore() or
 * archContextSwitch().
 *
 * (COSMIC & SDCC) On this port we take advantage of the fact
 * that when the context switch routine is called these compilers will
 * automatically stack all registers which should not be clobbered.
 * This means that the context switch need only save and restore the
 * stack pointer, which is stored in the thread's TCB. Because of
 * this, it is not necessary to prefill a new thread's stack with any
 * register values here. The only entry we need to make in the stack
 * is the thread's entry point - this is not exactly restored when
 * the thread is context switched in, but rather is popped off the
 * stack by the context switch routine's RET call. That is used to
 * direct the program counter to our thread's entry point - we are
 * faking a return to a caller which never actually existed.
 *
 * (IAR) The IAR compiler works around the lack of CPU registers on
 * STM8 by allocating some space in low SRAM which is used for
 * "virtual" registers. The compiler uses these like normal CPU
 * registers, and hence their values must be preserved when
 * context-switching between threads. Some of these (?b8 to ?b15)
 * are expected to be preserved by called functions, and hence we
 * actually need to save/restore those registers (unlike the rest
 * of the virtual registers and the standard CPU registers). We
 * therefore must prefill the stack with values for ?b8 to ?b15
 * here.
 *
 * We could pre-initialise the stack so that the RET call goes
 * directly to the thread entry point, with the thread entry
 * parameter filled in. On this architecture, however, we use an
 * outer thread shell routine which is used to call all threads.
 * The thread entry point and parameter are stored in the thread's
 * TCB which the thread shell uses to make the actual call to the
 * entry point. We don't therefore need to store the actual thread
 * entry and parameter within the stack.
 *
 * Note that interrupts must be enabled the first time a thread is
 * run. On some architectures this might be done by setting an
 * initial value for the interrupt-enable register within the stack
 * area. In this port, however, we use the thread shell to enable
 * interrupts at the start of any thread.

/**
 *
 * System tick ISR.
 *
 * This is responsible for regularly calling the OS system tick handler.
 * The system tick handler checks if any timer callbacks are necessary,
 * and runs the scheduler.
 *
 * The CPU automatically saves all registers before calling out to an
 * interrupt handler like this.
 *
 * The system may decide to schedule in a new thread during the call to
 * atomTimerTick(), in which case the program counter will be redirected
 * to the new thread's running location during atomIntExit(). This ISR
 * function will not actually complete until the thread we interrupted is
 * scheduled back in, at which point the end of this function will be
 * reached (after atomIntExit()) and the IRET call by the compiler will
 * return us to the interrupted thread as if we hadn't run any other
 * thread in the meantime. In other words the interrupted thread can be
 * scheduled out by atomIntExit() and several threads could run before we
 * actually reach the end of this function. When this function does
 * finally complete, the return address (the PC of the thread which was
 * interrupted) will be on the interrupted thread's stack because it was
 * saved on there by the CPU when the interrupt triggered.
 *
 * As with all interrupts, the ISR should call atomIntEnter() and
 * atomIntExit() on entry and exit. This serves two purposes:
 *
 * a) To notify the OS that it is running in interrupt context
 * b) To defer the scheduler until after the ISR is completed
 *
 * We defer all scheduling decisions until after the ISR has completed
 * in case the interrupt handler makes more than one thread ready.

NXP LPC17xx Platform

The "lpc17xx" platform contains sources for building the Atomthreads test 
suite for the NXP LPC17xx microcontroller.

The build was tested on the "mbed NXP LPC1768" board (http://www.mbed.org)
but it should work on any LPC17xx development board where UART0 can be used 
to monitor the output of the test. 

The NXP LPC17xx microcontrollers use the ARM Cortex M3 processor core. The 
source code in this example uses the ARM CMSIS Cortex-M Access Library V2.01 
to initialize the platform and Newlib as the runtime library. Also it uses a 
driver provided by NXP for the UART. The CMSIS library and the UART driver 
are provided as source with the sample and Newlib is expected to be installed 
together with the GNU ARM tool chain.

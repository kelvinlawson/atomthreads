QEMU Stellaris LM3S6965 Platform

The "qemu_lm3s" platform contains sources for building a sample Atomthreads 
application for the Stellaris LM3S6965 platform.


ISSUES:

There seems to be several problems for the QEMU Cortex M3 processor. The 
platform and port contains specific hacks to make it work on the QEMU 1.2.0 
release it was tested on. Also see the latest patches for QEMU.

Fixes implemented for the QEMU 1.2.0 release:

1.  Install the patch http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/180315/ 
2.  Use the PLATFORM_QEMU_LM3S_HACK define in the Makefile:

       - Disabling interrupts on the processor does not work (verified).
       - Disabling interrupts of the Cortex M Sys Tick Interrupt does not 
         work (verified).
       - NVIC Interrupt priorities not implemented correctly (not verified).

Because of the problems with the Sys Tick Interrupt the The Stellaris 
General-Purpose Timer Module (GPTM) was used to generate the system timer 
tick.

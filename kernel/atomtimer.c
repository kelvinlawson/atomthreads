/** 
 * \file
 * Timer and system tick library.
 *
 *
 * This module implements kernel system tick / clock functionality and timer
 * functionality for kernel and application code.
 *
 * \par Timer callbacks
 * Application and kernel code uses this module to request callbacks at a
 * specific number of system ticks in the future. atomTimerRegister() can be
 * called with a structure filled out requesting callbacks in a specific
 * number of ticks. When the timer expires the requested callback function is
 * called.
 *
 * \par Thread delays
 * Application threads can use atomTimerDelay() to request that the thread
 * delay for the specified number of system ticks. The thread will be put in
 * the timer list and taken off the ready queue. When the timer expires the
 * thread will be made ready-to-run again. This internally uses the same
 * atomTimerRegister() function that is used for registering all timers.
 *
 * \par System tick / Clock
 * This module also implements the system tick. At a predefined interval
 * (SYSTEM_TICKS_PER_SEC) architecture ports arrange for atomTimerTick() to be
 * called. The tick increments the system tick count, which can be queried by
 * application code using atomTimeGet(). On this tick, the registered timer
 * list is checked for any timers which have expired. Those which have expired
 * have their callback functions called. It is also on this system tick that
 * round-robin rescheduling time-slices occur. On exit from the tick interrupt
 * handler the kernel checks whether there are two or more threads 
 * ready-to-run at the same priority, and if so uses round-robin to schedule
 * in the next thread. This is in contrast to other (non-timer-tick)
 * interrupts which do not allow for round-robin rescheduling to occur, as
 * they should only occur on a new timer tick.
 *

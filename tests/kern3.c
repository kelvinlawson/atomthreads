/**
 * \b test_start
 *
 * Start kernel test.
 *
 * This tests the scheduling of threads at different priorities, and
 * preemption of lower priority threads by higher priority threads.
 *
 * Much of this functionality is already tested implicitly by the
 * semaphore, mutex tests etc but we repeat it here within the kernel
 * tests for completeness.
 *
 * Two threads are created at different priorities, with each thread
 * setting a running flag whenever it runs. We check that when the
 * higher priority thread is ready to run, only the higher priority
 * thread's running flag is set (even though the lower priority
 * thread should also be setting it at this time). This checks that
 * the scheduler is correctly prioritising thread execution.
 *
 * The test also exercises preemption, by disabling setting of the
 * running flag in the higher priority thread for a period. During
 * this time the higher priority thread repeatedly sleeps for one
 * system tick then wakes up to check the sleep-request flag again.
 * Every time the higher priority thread wakes up, it has preempted
 * the lower priority thread (which is always running). By ensuring
 * that the higher priority thread is able to start running again
 * after one of these periods (through checking the running flag)
 * we prove that the preemption has worked.

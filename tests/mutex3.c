/**
 * \b test_start
 *
 * Start mutex test.
 *
 * With multiple threads blocking on a single mutex, this test confirms that
 * they are woken in order when the mutex is released. The correct order for
 * waking is that the higher priority threads are woken first, followed by the
 * lower priority threads. Where multiple threads of the same priority are
 * waiting, the threads are woken in FIFO order (the order in which they started
 * waiting on the mutex).
 *
 * To test this we create four threads which all wait on a single mutex.
 * One pair of threads are running at high priority, with the other pair at a
 * lower priority:
 *
 * Thread 1: low prio thread A
 * Thread 2: low prio thread B
 * Thread 3: high prio thread A
 * Thread 4: high prio thread B
 *
 * The threads are forced to start blocking on the same mutex in the
 * above order.
 *
 * We expect to see them woken up in the following order:
 *  3, 4, 1, 2
 *
 * This proves the multiple blocking thread ordering in terms of both
 * the priority-queueing and same-priority-FIFO-queueing.

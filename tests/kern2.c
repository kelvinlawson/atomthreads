/**
 * \b test_start
 *
 * Start kernel test.
 *
 * This is a basic test of the thread context-switch functionality. It
 * creates twenty local (byte) variables and schedules the thread out
 * for one second. If context-switch save/restore is not implemented
 * correctly, you might expect one or more of these local variables to
 * be corrupted by the time the thread is scheduled back in.
 *
 * Note that this is a fairly unsophisticated test, and a lot depends on
 * how the compiler deals with the variables, as well as what code is
 * executed while the thread is scheduled out. It should flag up any
 * major problems with the context-switch, however.
 *
 * @retval Number of failures

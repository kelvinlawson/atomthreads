 * mutex implementation in the mutex module.
 *
 * The semaphore sem1 is initialised with a count of 1. Whichever
 * thread holds this semaphore can then modify the global variable
 * "shared_data".
 *
 * The main thread first takes the "mutex" sem1, then creates a
 * second thread. The second thread should block on the sem1 mutex
 * until the main thread releases it. The test checks that the
 * global "shared_data" is not modified by the second thread
 * until the main thread releases the mutex.
